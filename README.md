This is my first ever application written in Vue. I worked on it for a few days and I struggled to deploy it on Github Pages for a while. This simple application allows user to create and delete folders. In every folder user can add, delete and mark a task/'to do' as completed by simply tapping on it. After refreshing site all folders and tasks disappear as there is no back-end to save data on server. I was thinking about saving data on client but I don't consider this solution good enaugh. Looks best on mobile devices.
